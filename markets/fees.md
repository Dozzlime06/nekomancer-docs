# Fees

Simple fee structure. No hidden costs.

---

## Trading Fee

**2% per trade**

Applied when you buy shares. Automatically sent to the protocol treasury.

Example:
- You spend 100 USDC
- 2 USDC goes to treasury
- 98 USDC buys shares

---

## No Other Fees

- No deposit fees
- No withdrawal fees
- No claiming fees
- No gas subsidies (you pay normal Monad gas)

---

## Buyback & Burn

**100% of platform fees go to $MANCER buyback and burn.**

Every trade generates fees. Those fees buy $MANCER from the market and burn it permanently.

This creates constant buy pressure and deflationary supply.

How it works:
1. You trade → 2% fee collected in USDC
2. USDC swaps to $MANCER automatically
3. $MANCER sent to burn address
4. Supply decreases forever

More volume = more burns = less supply.
