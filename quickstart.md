## Step 5: Wait for Resolution

Markets resolve after their deadline:

1. Anyone can propose the outcome (requires 5 USDC bond)
2. 24-hour challenge window opens
3. If no challenge, outcome is finalized
4. If challenged, another 24-hour round begins

## Step 6: Claim Winnings

If your side won:

1. Go to **Portfolio**
2. Find your winning position
3. Click **Claim**
4. Receive USDC (1:1 for winning shares)

If you lost, your shares are worthless. No action needed.

## Tips

- Watch the prices. When a market moves, you can sell for profit before resolution.
- Smaller markets = more price impact. Large trades move prices more.
- Challenge window protects everyone. If you see a wrong outcome proposed, challenge it.
