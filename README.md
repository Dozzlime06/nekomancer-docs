**On-chain prediction markets. No middlemen. No trust required.**

Nekomancer is a permissionless prediction market protocol deployed on Monad. You bet on outcomes. The blockchain settles everything.

## What is this?

A prediction market where you buy shares in outcomes. If you're right, you win. If you're wrong, you lose. Simple.

- **Crypto** — BTC above $100k by EOY?
- **Sports** — Lakers win the championship?
- **Politics** — Who wins the next election?
- **Pop Culture** — Will the movie break box office records?

Every market has YES and NO shares. Prices move based on demand. When the event resolves, winning shares pay out $1 each. Losers get nothing.

All platform fees (2% per trade) go to **buyback and burn** of $NEKO.

More volume → more burns → less supply → increased scarcity.
