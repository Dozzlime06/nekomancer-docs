# Making Your First Swap

This guide walks you through swapping tokens on Nekomancer.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- A connected wallet (see [Connecting Your Wallet](connecting-wallet.md))
- Some MON in your wallet for gas fees
- Tokens to swap (MON or any supported token)

## Step-by-Step Swap Guide

### 1. Go to Swap Page
Visit [nekomancer.fun/swap](https://www.nekomancer.fun/swap)

### 2. Select "From" Token
Click the top token selector and choose the token you want to sell.
- For your first swap, try swapping MON

### 3. Select "To" Token
Click the bottom token selector and choose the token you want to buy.

### 4. Enter Amount
Type the amount you want to swap in the top input field.
- The output amount will be calculated automatically
- You'll see the exchange rate and price impact

### 5. Review Details
Check the swap details:
- **Rate**: How many tokens you'll receive per input token
- **Price Impact**: How much your trade affects the price (lower is better)
- **Minimum Received**: Guaranteed minimum after slippage

### 6. Click "Swap"
If everything looks good, click the Swap button.

### 7. Approve Token (First Time Only)
If selling a token (not MON), you'll need to approve it first:
1. Click "Approve" in your wallet popup
2. Wait for the approval transaction to confirm
3. Then confirm the actual swap

### 8. Confirm in Wallet
Your wallet will show the transaction details:
- Verify the amounts look correct
- Check the gas fee
- Click "Confirm"

### 9. Wait for Confirmation
The swap usually completes in 1-2 seconds on Monad.

### 10. Done!
Your new tokens will appear in your wallet. You can verify on [monvision.io](https://monvision.io).

## Tips for Better Swaps

### Slippage Settings
- Default slippage is 0.5%
- Increase to 1-2% for volatile tokens
- Click the settings gear to adjust

### Large Trades
- Our aggregator may split large trades across DEXes
- This gives you better prices on big swaps

### Gas Fees
- Monad gas is very cheap
- Complex routes may cost slightly more gas but save on price

## Common Issues

### "Insufficient Balance"
You don't have enough tokens. Check your wallet balance.

### "Price Impact Too High"
The trade is too large for available liquidity. Try a smaller amount.

### "Transaction Failed"
- Try increasing slippage
- Make sure you have enough MON for gas
- The price may have moved - try again
