# Proposing Outcomes

After a market's deadline, anyone can propose the outcome.

---

## Requirements

- Market deadline has passed
- No outcome currently proposed
- 5 USDC for the proposal bond

---

## How to Propose

1. Go to the market page
2. Click **Propose Outcome**
3. Select YES or NO
4. Confirm the 5 USDC bond
5. Submit transaction

---

## What Happens Next

Your proposal starts a 24-hour challenge window.

If nobody challenges:
- Outcome is finalized
- You get your 5 USDC back
- Winners can claim

If someone challenges:
- A new 24-hour round begins
- Challenger's proposed outcome becomes active
- You lose your 5 USDC bond to the challenger

---

## Choosing Correctly

Only propose outcomes you can verify. Check the resolution source listed on the market.

Wrong proposals = lost bonds.

---

## Bond Recovery

Correct proposals get full bond return after:
- Challenge window expires, or
- Market finalizes with your proposed outcome

The bond is returned to your trading balance automatically.

---

## Why Propose?

- Help finalize markets you traded in
- Earn challenger bonds if someone incorrectly challenges you
- Community service (markets need resolution to function)

There's no direct reward for proposing, but it enables you to claim your winnings faster.
