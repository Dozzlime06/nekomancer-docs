# Claiming Winnings

After a market resolves, winners claim their payouts.

---

## When You Can Claim

- Market has a finalized outcome
- You hold shares on the winning side
- Challenge period has ended

---

## How to Claim

1. Go to **Portfolio**
2. Find the resolved market
3. Click **Claim**
4. Confirm transaction
5. USDC added to your trading balance

## Payout Calculation

Winning shares pay $1.00 each.

```
payout = winning_shares × 1.00 USDC
```

Example:
- You bought 50 YES shares at $0.40 each = $20 spent
- Market resolves YES
- You claim 50 × $1.00 = $50 USDC
- Profit: $30

## Losing Positions

If your side lost, there's nothing to claim. Your shares are worthless.

No action needed. The shares just stay in your portfolio marked as "Lost."

---

## Claiming to Wallet

After claiming, USDC goes to your trading balance.

To withdraw to your wallet:
1. Go to **Wallet**
2. Click **Withdraw**
3. Enter amount
4. Confirm transaction

USDC is sent directly to your connected wallet.

## Unclaimed Winnings

No deadline to claim. Your winnings stay in the contract forever until you claim them.

But why wait? Claim and compound into new markets.
