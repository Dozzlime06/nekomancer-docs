# Challenging

See a wrong outcome proposed? Challenge it.

---

## Requirements

- Active proposal exists
- Within the 24-hour challenge window
- 10 USDC for the challenge bond

---

## How to Challenge

1. Go to the market page
2. See the current proposal
3. Click **Challenge**
4. Confirm the 10 USDC bond
5. Submit transaction

Your challenge:
- Flips the proposed outcome (YES → NO, or NO → YES)
- Starts a new 24-hour window
- Puts your outcome as the active proposal

---

## What Happens After

If nobody counter-challenges:
- Your outcome is finalized
- You get your 10 USDC back
- You also get the original proposer's 5 USDC

If someone counter-challenges:
- Another round begins
- You lose your bond if the final outcome isn't yours

---

## Escalating Bonds

Each round, bonds increase:

| Round | Proposal Bond | Challenge Bond |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | 5 USDC | 10 USDC |
| 2 | 10 USDC | 20 USDC |
| 3 | 20 USDC | 40 USDC |

This prevents infinite griefing. Eventually, someone has to be right or walk away.

## Timeout

If 7 days pass with unresolved challenges, the market is voided.

All positions are refunded. No winners or losers.

---

## When to Challenge

Challenge when:
- The proposed outcome is objectively wrong
- You can verify the correct answer from the resolution source
- You're willing to put up the bond

Don't challenge just to delay. You'll lose money.
