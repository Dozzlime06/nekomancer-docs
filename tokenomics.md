# Tokenomics

$MANCER — The native token of Nekomancer.

---

## Overview

$MANCER is a deflationary utility token. All platform fees go to buying and burning $MANCER permanently.

**After launch, $MANCER becomes the native currency for predictions.** Instead of USDC, users will bet using $MANCER tokens directly.

---

## Buyback & Burn Mechanism

Every trade on Nekomancer generates a 2% fee.

```
Trade → Fee (USDC) → Swap to $MANCER → Burn
```

This happens automatically on every single trade:

1. User buys shares for 100 USDC
2. 2 USDC fee collected
3. Fee swaps to $MANCER via DEX
4. $MANCER sent to dead address
5. Supply permanently reduced

**More trading = more burns = smaller supply = increased scarcity**

---

## Post-Launch: $MANCER as Prediction Currency

After the initial launch phase:

- **All predictions made with $MANCER** (not USDC)
- Users buy $MANCER to participate in markets
- Winning payouts in $MANCER
- Creates constant demand for the token
- Burns still happen from platform fees

This creates a dual flywheel:
1. **Demand:** Users need $MANCER to bet
2. **Supply reduction:** Fees burn $MANCER

More users → more demand → more volume → more burns → scarcity increases.

## Why Deflationary?

Most tokens inflate. Staking rewards, LP emissions, team unlocks — they all dilute holders.

$MANCER is different. The only direction is down.

- Platform grows → more volume → more burns
- More burns → less supply → increased scarcity
- Simple math. No complexity.
