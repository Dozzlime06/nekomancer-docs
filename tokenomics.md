# Tokenomics

$NEKO — The native token of Nekomancer.

---

## Overview

$NEKO is a deflationary utility token. All platform fees go to buying and burning $NEKO permanently.

---

## Buyback & Burn Mechanism

Every trade on Nekomancer generates a 2% fee.

```
Trade → Fee (USDC) → Swap to $NEKO → Burn
```

This happens automatically on every single trade:

1. User buys shares for 100 USDC
2. 2 USDC fee collected
3. Fee swaps to $NEKO via DEX
4. $NEKO sent to dead address
5. Supply permanently reduced

**More trading = more burns = smaller supply = increased scarcity**

## Contract

Token contract: [TBA]

Will be verified and renounced after launch.

---

## Burn Transparency

All burns are on-chain and verifiable:

- Burn transactions visible on explorer
- Running total tracked on website
- Monthly burn reports on Twitter

---

## Why Deflationary?

Most tokens inflate. Staking rewards, LP emissions, team unlocks — they all dilute holders.

$NEKO is different. The only direction is down.

- Platform grows → more volume → more burns
- More burns → less supply → increased scarcity
- Simple math. No complexity.
